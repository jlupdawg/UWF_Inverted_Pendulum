Install VNCViewer by RealVNC (https://www.realvnc.com/en/)
Set your ethernet connection to match the nanos IP Address (for Windows 10):
	Start -> "Network & Internet" -> "Change Adapert Options"
	Double click "Ethernet" -> "Properties"
	Double click "Internet Protocol Version 4"
	Select "Use the following IP Address"
	IP Address: xxx.yyy.zzz.1 (xxx.yyy.zzz to match nano) (Currently: 172.20.4.1)
	Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
	Optional : Match DNS Servers with the nano
Link your computer the the Nano using an ethernet cable. 
Open VNCViewer and connect to xxx.yyy.zzz.QQQ (matching nano IP) (Currently: 172.20.4.200)
Password: nvidia

Note: The resolution will probably be very small. The effort to try and change it probably isn't worth the time
For long periods of work I suggest using one of the projectors in a classroom.
